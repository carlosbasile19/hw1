Final version of the homework 1.

This is a diary-based app designed to give users a safe place to store their memories. With this app, users can create multiple diaries and add entries to each one. They can easily favorite entries they want to remember and remove entries they no longer need. The app is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it the perfect choice for anyone looking to keep their memories safe and organized.

For the next version, we will have a Laravel-based structure that expresses the MVC framework!
